          <p><u>The Godfather</u></p>
          <br><br><br>

          
          <p><strong>to end the feud</strong> - an argument that has exixted for a long time between two people or groups, causing a lot of anger or violence <br> <br>
          a family feud <br> <br>
          a ten-year-old feud between the two countries <br><br>
          Devastated by Sonny's death and realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant Don Emilio Barzini, Vito attempts to end the feud. He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder.
            <br><br><br>
            <strong>to buy out</strong> -  a situation in which a person or group buys all the shares belonging to a company and so gets control of it <br><br>
            a management buyout <br><br>
            Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos.
            <br><br><br>
            <strong>has fallen under Greene's sway</strong> - in or into a state of being controlled by someone <br><br>
            they are under the sway of terrorist <br><br>
            Michael is dismayed to see that Fredo has fallen under Greene's sway. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
            <br><br><br>


            <strong>the baptism of the Corleone baby</strong> - a Christian ceremony in which a person has water poured on their head, or is covered for a very short time in water, in order to show that that person has become a member of the Christian Church <br><br>
            infant baptism <br><br>
            The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby.
            <br><br><br>


            <strong>Carlo Rizzi's complicity</strong> - involvement in a crime or some activity that is wrong <br><br>
            While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone assassins murder the other New York dons and Moe Greene. Tessio is executed for his treachery and Michael extracts Carlo's confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny's murder for Barzini. A Corleone capo, Peter Clemenza, garrotes Carlo with a wire.
            <br><br><br>
            
            <strong>they pay reverence to Michael</strong> - showing deep respect or admiration toward somebody <br><br>
            Connie accuses Michael of the murder, telling Kay that Michael ordered all the killings. Kay is relieved when Michael finally denies it, but when the capos arrive, they address her husband as Don Corleone and she watches them pay reverence to Michael as the newly installed don as they close the door on her.
            <br><br><br>

            So these were the original vocab of the very first Godfather movie what I've sort out. In the following, here comes some really good describing language from an article: <br><br>
            Originally, Copola did not want to cast his sister, Talia Shire, fearing he would be accused of nepotism. <br><br>
            <strong>nepotism</strong> - the act of using your power or influence to get good jobs or unfair advantages for members of your own family. One of a visible and noticible form of corruption.
            <br><br><br>
            <strong>abiding</strong> memory - long-lasting, ever lasting memory<br><br>
            Is it the abiding male fascination with figures of power and authority, and hierarchies of dominance?
            <br><br><br>
            
            Johnny Fortane was chastised by his godfather. - to discipline, to punish someone, especialy by hitting him
                        <br><br><br>
            
            The patriarchal culture of the Mafia, at least as portrayed in this film, requires a rigid separation of the roles of men and women. Women have no power, but neither do they have to shoulder the heavy responsibilities that the men bear. In this way, the men can justify their <strong>subordination of women</strong> and even romanticize and ennoble their own sufferings and "sacrifices." I wonder what the tale of The Godfather would have been like, had it been told by Michael's mother Carmela?
            <br><br><br>
            
            After the film appeared, actual mobsters are said to have imitated Corleone - changing their speech to be less foul-mouthed, more soft-spoken and more <strong>refined</strong>.
            <br><br><br>
            
            Puzo several times mentions in the novel that Don Corleone is straight-laced in matters of sex. He does not approve of <strong>lewd wedding songs</strong> or his son Santino's flirting with his sister's maid of honor.
            <br><br><br>
            
            All this is part of the film's idealization of Don Corleone. He is a ruthless man, easily capable of murder, but <strong>he is redeemed by the fact</strong> that he subscribes to a strict moral code of his own, and by the fact that the "legitimate" structures of power are also corrupt. Corleone's refusal to get involved in hard drugs drives the plot, because the rest of the mob is less scrupulous than he, but they still need his political contacts.
            <br><br><br>


            The Don at the meeting of the Five Families (wearing another <strong>impeccable</strong> suit). Behind him, Robert Duvall as the consigliere Tom Hagen. So the suit was simply impeccable. Perfect. Smart. Flawless. you know... Just impeccable.
            <br><br><br>
            
            The scene where he <strong>caresses</strong> a cat in his lap as he talks business is justly famous.
            <br><br><br>
            
            Sonny and Michael, who are perfect foils for each other. Sonny, the eldest, is quick-tempered, impulsive, lustful and physically brutish-very masculine, but in ways that make him a bad head of the family. <br> This sentence just speaks for itself. It is simply unnecessary to ephasize it, to dwell on it.
            <br><br><br>
            
            As the Don says, "Women and children can afford to be careless. Men can't."<br><br>
            I just leave this here...
            <br><br><br>
            
            Sonny (James Caan) is shown with <strong>disheveled clothes</strong> that emphasize his masculinity. But it's the wrong kind. <br>
            So with the adjective "disheveled" we've met before in the Order of the Phoenix. As I recall, Umbridge weared a disheveled hair, dress and outlook in general when she was totally mad and pissed on Harry and the others. Like a stranded dog, a total madness.
            <br><br><br>
            
            To kill is a classic ordeal of courage, a test of manliness found in cultures and subcultures where modern legal systems are nonexistent or ignored. <br>
            So "ordeal of courage", as a trial of courage a necessary step to take towards a future goal.
            <br><br><br>

            Michael's wife will be protected from the burden, from the responsibilities, the moral depravity of his work, and its stringent code of silence. But she will never be as close to him as his male subordinates; she will never know his secrets. <br>
            Wow, that's deep. So depravity, in other words moral corruption, wickedness. Something which has to do with bad immorality.  You are a depraved person for example, a total wrack if you are a grown-up man and have inappropriate thoughts of having a relationship with a little girl.
            <br><br><br>
            
            You will see the kind of clarity the terms tactical and strategic bring to the discussion. <br>
            You'll see the difference between the two of them. You'll notice how bright is the opposition of these two.
            <br><br><br><br>

            <u>The Godfather Part III:</u>

I dread you.

Call a meeting my friend, so there are no debts or gudges.

We came here and now it is time for us to dissolve the business relationship between us.

A habit born of a long contemplation of eternity.

It clouded his reason.

I'm not the victim of a swindle.

The mind suffers, the body cries out.

We must seize the moment.

What is the point of confessing if I don't repent.

I have a stone in my shoe.
